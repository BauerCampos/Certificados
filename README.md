## 🎯 Business Problem
**Objective:** Build a classifier to predict whether a bank customer is likely to default on a loan.

**Impact:**
- Reduce financial losses for banks
- Enable better loan approval decisions
- Minimize risk exposure

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Credit Risk Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset)

**Features:**
- `person_age`: Customer age
- `person_income`: Annual Income
- `person_home_ownership`: Home ownership
- `person_emp_length`: Employment length (in years)
- `loan_intent`: Purpose of the loan
- `loan_grade`:Loan grade
- `loan_amnt`: Loan amount requested
- `loan_int_rate`: Interest rate
- `loan_percent_income`: Percent income
- `cb_person_default_on_file`: Historical default
- `cb_preson_cred_hist_length`: Credit history length
- `loan_status`: Target variable (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk)

## 🔧 Future Improvements
**Embeddings**
Embeddings are a powerful technique for encoding categorical variables, particularly effective for nominal data. Research and practical applications demonstrate their superiority over traditional methods (e.g., one-hot encoding) when preprocessing data for AI models, especially in deep learning.

**Multiple Imputation**
Two fields contained missing values: person_emp_length and loan_int_rate.

    person_emp_length: Nulls were imputed with 0 (assuming nulls indicated no employment history).

    loan_int_rate: Nulls were replaced with the global mean, as these likely represented lost data.

For higher accuracy, regression-based imputation (e.g., MICE) could predict missing values individually by leveraging relationships between variables.
